## Background Overview
As a Data Analyst at Neurowear, a wearable tech company focused on cognitive wellness, I was tasked with evaluating the post-launch performance of our first consumer product: the Halo One. This smart headband helps users improve focus, sleep quality, and mental resilience using biometric feedback and real-time app support.
The product was officially launched on January 1, 2023 across the United States.

Halo One comes in two tiers:
 -	Base version ($249.99) – includes Sleep Tracking, Focus Mode, and Stress Monitoring
 -	Pro version ($349.99) – adds advanced features like Mood Analysis and Cognitive Coaching
Six months post-launch, leadership requested a deep-dive analysis of customer behavior, product engagement, and market performance across key channels and regions.
 
## Project Goals
-	Understand who bought the product and how soon after launch
-	Measure feature adoption by version and user type
-	Evaluate user satisfaction and app engagement
-	Identify trends in Pro vs Base adoption and purchase channel
-	Recommend strategies for product and marketing optimization
 
## Data Model Summary
The dataset includes information about users, their orders, and how they engaged with the product. It captures user demographics and location, purchase details such as revenue and whether they bought the Base or Pro version, feature adoption across five key product features, and feedback data including user ratings, minutes of engagement, and first-month activity. Together, this data provides a complete view of customer behavior, adoption trends, satisfaction, and revenue performance.

## Key Insights

### Pro Version Drives Revenue
-	Approximately 30% of users purchased the Pro version
-	This segment contributed approximately 40% of total revenue — a realistic outcome due to the $100 price difference, demonstrating the financial value of premium pricing despite a smaller user base
 
### Feature Adoption Patterns
-	Sleep Tracking is the most widely used feature (~55.6% adoption)
-	Focus Mode is enabled by ~58.6% of users
-	Stress Monitoring is evenly adopted (~49.5%) and available to both Base and Pro users
-	Mood Analysis and Cognitive Coaching are exclusive to Pro users, with adoption rates of ~58.5% and ~49.3%, confirming Pro features are actively used
 
### Early Buyers Are More Engaged
-	Early adopters (Week 1–2) represented ~20% of all orders
-	Month 2–3 buyers and Late adopters (post-Month 3) each made up ~29% of orders

-	Average sessions in the first month: ~16
-	Average daily minutes of usage: ~270

### Usage Behavior Mirrors Feature Enablement
-	Users who enabled Sleep Tracking averaged ~440 minutes/day
-	Users without Sleep Tracking averaged ~55 minutes/day
-	This reflects the higher stickiness and passive engagement driven by always-on features like sleep monitoring
 
### Feedback Trends
-	Average user rating across all users was ~3.7
-	Users with fewer than 2 sessions in the first month were disproportionately represented among 1–2 star ratings, suggesting early churn is linked to dissatisfaction
 
## Recommendations 

1. **Upsell Sleep-Focused Users to Pro**  
- Users who enabled Sleep Tracking showed significantly higher engagement (~440 minutes/day vs. ~55), demonstrating the feature's impact on retention.  
   - *Strategy:* Target high-engagement base users with personalized Pro upgrade campaigns highlighting Pro-only features like Mood Analysis and Cognitive Coaching.  

2. **Improve Onboarding for Low-Session Users**  
- Users with fewer than 2 sessions in their first month gave lower ratings (1–2 stars), showing a poor initial experience is tied to dissatisfaction and churn.  
   - *Strategy:* Deploy automated onboarding flows — app walkthroughs, push reminders, and welcome email sequences in the first week.  

3. **Expand Focus in High-Converting States**  
- States like New York, Texas, and Florida outperformed others in total sales.  
   - *Strategy:* Increase paid media and local partnerships in those regions.  

4. **Capture Feature-Level Satisfaction**  
- Current feedback is collected at the overall product level, but user sentiment may vary widely by feature. Capturing insights per feature will help identify which tools drive the most value and which need refinement.  
   - *Strategy:* Add short in-app micro-surveys tied to individual features to guide development priorities.  
 
## Conclusion
This analysis highlights how customer behavior, feature adoption, and regional performance directly shape product success. By uncovering trends in engagement and satisfaction, and linking them to revenue outcomes, we can identify concrete opportunities to improve retention, drive upgrades, and optimize marketing strategies. The findings and dashboard together provide leadership with actionable insights for guiding the next stage of product growth
